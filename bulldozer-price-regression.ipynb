    "* In this notebook, we are going to go through an example of machine learning project with the goal of predicting the scale price of bulldozers.\n",
    "### 1. Problem Definition\n",
    "* How well can we predict the future sale price of bulldozer, given its characteristics & previous examples of how much similar bulldozer have sold for?\n",
    "### 2. Data \n",
    "* The data is downloaded from the Kaggle Blue book for Bulldozer competition.\n",
    "##### https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data\n",
    "* There are 3 main Types of data:\n",
    "    * Train.csv is the training set, which contains data through the end of 2011.\n",
    "    * Valid.csv is the validation set, which contains data from January 1, 2012 - April 30, 2012 You make predictions on this set throughout the majority of the competition. Your score on this set is used to create the public leaderboard.\n",
    "    * Test.csv is the test set, which won't be released until the last week of the competition. It contains data from May 1, 2012 - November 2012. Your score on the test set determines your final rank for the competition\n",
    "### 3. Evaluation \n",
    "* The evaluation metric for this competition is the RMSLE (root mean squared log error) between the actual and predicted auction prices.\n",
    "##### https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bluebook-for-bulldozers/overview\n",
    "* The goal of most regression evaluation metrics is to minimize the error.\n",
    "### 4. Features \n",
    "Kaggle provides a data dictionary detailing all the feature of the dataset.\n",
